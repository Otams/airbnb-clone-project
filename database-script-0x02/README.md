# Airbnb Database Seeder

This script (`seed.sql`) populates the Airbnb database schema with sample data:

- 2 users (guest and host)
- 1 property listed by the host
- 1 confirmed booking by the guest
- 1 payment, 1 review, and 1 message between users

You can use this data to test queries, relationships, and database logic.
