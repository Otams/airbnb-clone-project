# Airbnb Database Schema

This script (`schema.sql`) contains SQL `CREATE TABLE` statements for the main entities in the Airbnb clone database:

- User
- Property
- Booking
- Payment
- Review
- Message

It defines primary keys, foreign keys, data types, constraints, and indexing for performance.

Run this file in a PostgreSQL or MySQL-compatible database to set up the schema.
